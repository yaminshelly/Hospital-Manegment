Our project is a hospital psychiatric ward management system. The system helps maintain the order and organization of the ward, by keeping data such as: patients, doctors and medications. In addition, the system helps to provide statistical knowledge about the ward in real time, and to provide information about crowded rooms or available beds in the ward when introducing new patients. In addition, the system has a tool for sending emails to an external email for use by department employees.
